# Paranoid Software Development Blog

This is our first official blog. It is developed using Plugster and GitHub Hosting.

It is a simple HTML application with one single page and a feed of articles by topics managed by 2 plugsters:

- Navigation bar plugster, it is responsible for providing navigation between topics.
- Feed plugster, it is responsible for displaying the blog entries related to the selected topic.

## Dependencies

- jQuery
- Plugster (._.)
- showdownjs
- Highlight.js
- Bootstrap

## The database

We use a simple JSON files based database with MD files to store and design the blog entries.

The MD files and the JSON files are located and organized by topic at the **db** folder.
